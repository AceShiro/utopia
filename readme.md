## Utopia - Albion Online Gold Market Tool

This project is a web application designed to store and track the gold market of Albion Online, as the tools in-game allow only to track the market on a 24 hours period.

In the actual version, the gold value still need to be add manually and regularly in the interface.


## Currently implemented

- Simple Dashboard with Panels redirecting to the different pages (WIP)
- Gold Market Page (Gold Flot Chart, Raw Data Dynamic Table, Add, Edit, Delete a Value)

*Despite the Flot Chart is working properly, the xAxis time displayed is bugged for a reason, TBResolved soon.*


## To Be Implemented

- Authentication & Permissions System (Login / Logout, Access Rights, etc)
- Upgrade of the Flot Chart to display the Exchange Rate between Gold and Euros
